# Mint Auth (React + Vite)

## Overview
Mint Auth is a React authentication application built with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. It provides a secure user authentication experience, featuring a complete signup flow with robust password validation, OTP email verification, and advanced security measures like biometric authentication and PIN lock screens. The application integrates with various third-party services for KYC, bank linking, and real-time market data, aiming to deliver a seamless and feature-rich financial management platform for managing personal finances and investments.

## User Preferences
- **Communication Style**: I prefer clear and concise communication. Avoid overly technical jargon unless necessary, and provide explanations that are easy to understand.
- **Coding Style**: I prefer clean, readable, and modular code. Favor functional components in React and maintain a consistent coding style throughout the project.
- **Workflow Preferences**: I prefer an iterative development approach. Break down tasks into smaller, manageable chunks and seek feedback regularly.
- **Interaction Preferences**: Ask before making any major architectural changes or introducing new dependencies. Provide a brief explanation for proposed changes.
- **General Working Preferences**: Do not make changes to the `server/` directory without explicit instruction, as this contains critical backend logic and third-party API integrations.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Design Language**: iOS-style UI with a "glassmorphism" design approach.
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and animations using Framer Motion.
- **Theming**: Tailwind CSS for rapid and consistent UI development.
- **Navigation**: iOS-style "swipe-back" navigation with previous page preview, scaling, and haptic feedback. Browser history is synced with the app's internal navigation stack.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with Vite.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3 and PostCSS.
- **State Management**: Context API for centralized state, especially notifications. Custom hooks for data fetching and logic encapsulation.
- **Authentication Flows**: Includes robust password validation, 6-digit OTP verification with progressive lockouts, and secure login attempts with cooldowns.
- **Biometric Authentication**: Integration with `capacitor-face-id` for native iOS/Android biometrics.
- **PIN Lock Screen**: 5-digit PIN setup with SHA-256 hashing for session security.
- **User Onboarding**: A 6-step identification process including employment details, Sumsub KYC, discretionary mandate, risk disclosure, source of funds, bank account details, and T&C agreements.
- **Minimum Investment Enforcement**: Calculates sums raw `shares × (last_price/100)`.
- **Notification System**: Centralized real-time notifications via Supabase subscriptions, grouped by date, with swipe-to-delete and "mark all as read" functionality.
- **Settlement Config**: `fullyIntegrated: true` from `/api/settlement/config.js`. Portfolio data based on `stock_holdings` records and strategy matching.
- **MINT MORNINGS Scheduled Email**: Daily newsletter sender using `server/mintMorningsCron.cjs` and Vercel Cron.
- **Filter Persistence**: `src/lib/usePersistedFilters.js` for localStorage-based filter save/restore across `marketsInvest`, `marketsStrategies`, and `openStrategies` contexts.
- **Portfolio Equity Curve Chart**: Displays P&L equity curve on the home page balance card (`SwipeableBalanceCard.jsx`) with various timeframes. Charts show gain/loss starting from R0 and can be anchored to the user's purchase date.
- **PDF Factsheet Generation**: Client-side PDF generation (`generateFactsheetPdf.js`) for strategy factsheets, including personalized investment details.
- **Order Email Notifications**: Confirmation and fill emails sent via Resend for investment transactions, logged to the `order_emails` table.
