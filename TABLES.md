## ⚠️ Key Data Conventions

| Convention | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Prices in cents** | `securities_c.last_price`, `stock_holdings_c.avg_fill`, `transactions.amount`, `gift_claims.amount`, `family_members.available_balance` are all in **cents** |
| **Wallet balance in Rands** | `wallets.balance` is stored in **Rands** (e.g. `1500.00`) — divide cents by 100 before writing |
| **`_c` suffix tables** | Market data tables (`securities_c`, `strategies_c`, `stock_holdings_c`, etc.) are populated/managed by external data pipelines, not directly by user actions |
| **`client_strategy_returns_c`** | Written by an external P&L job. Use `basket_value` deltas for chart/badge consistency — do not rely on pre-computed `inception_pnl` |
| **`required_actions`** | Single row per user; upserted by onboarding and KYC webhooks to drive the Actions Needed UI |
